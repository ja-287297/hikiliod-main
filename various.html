    <h1>Explanations</h1>

    <br>
    <p>so i gotta explain whith such creative freedom comes writers blocks so i'm not sure if i can turn this into a daily blog, so i can only really put what i can think of.
        i also gotta use better word choice and punctuation, this is sounding repetitive.

    <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
    <p>one thing im certain about putting on here is a place for all of my files or accomplishments ive made just in case people are really curious &#40most likely not&#41. for example gameplay footage of me playing something or a funny song i composed, the possibilities are only limited by my posessions.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<p>the idea of making this a school unblocker also came to my head, but i decided to reject the idea due to it potentially having too much demand or having to deal with my dictator-like principal, same thing with making a confession page on here.</p>
