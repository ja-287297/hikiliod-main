        <h2>About me</h2>
   
        <p>my name is Pous and i am a straight male who also spends a majority of his time online because he has nothing else better to do.

        <h2>Reason</h2>
        
        <p>if im going to be honest with you i dont have one straight reason for creating this website, i just thought itd be cool to show people and use it for file dumps and projects. i definitely need to learn more css and javascript if i want to make this website look nice.
            so for now you will have this early internet looking webpage untill i have something working to make it look nicer, although in the meantime this could also become a blog.</p>
