    <h1>Ai website modeling</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>i have just realized i could use ai to make the designs for the website which is very useful but i feel like im cheating in some sort of way by doing that, it just does'nt fel right. i mean at least its a good free alterative to things like wix or squarespace,, im not willing to spend the money for that. i have put a link of an ai version of my website through gpt-3 at the main page and <a href="aei.html">here</a>.   ive also generated another version of the website but i have lost it due to my data being full on my other device. the one this ai came with was okay but not the best, the blue just threw me off, i want to find a balance between an old website layout and a modern website layout, maybe i need to study more websites to find and grasp an idea of my desired website layout and format. </p>
